Introduction

What DiffKit is
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DiffKit is an application for comparing two <<Real-World-Entities,tables>> of
data, field-by-field. DiffKit is able to report the differences
(<<Diff,__Diff__>>s) at both the row and field level, and allows the user to
configure how to carry out the comparison (what to compare, what to ignore).
DiffKit is highly configurable with respect to the sources of tabular data, the
details of the comparison, and the characteristics of the diff report (output).
For instance, DiffKit is able to diff MS Excel files, RDBMS tables, CSV files,
or custom data sources, in any combination.

DiffKit is able to
compare fields within a prescribed tolerance (e.g. numeric field values will be
flagged as different only if the difference exceeds some threshold), is able to
diff text fields ignoring incidental formatting differences, and is able to
output the diffs as a structured text report or as SQL insert statements. This
is just a small sampling of the capabilities of DiffKit.

DiffKit is also a framework. It is Free Open Source Software (FOSS). DiffKit is
written in the Java programming language and is dependent on only the Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) and a handful of third party FOSS libraries that are
packaged as part of the DiffKit distribution. As an Open Source framework with
few dependencies, DiffKit can be easily and cleanly embedded in almost any Java
application, or any application that can bind Java packages.

DiffKit was designed to be easily extensible. That means it requires only a very
modest java programming effort to create custom row data providers
(<<Source,__Source__s>>), custom field comparators (<<Diffor,__Diffor__s>>), and
custom output formatters (<<Sink,__Sink__s>>).

DiffKit is a command-line application that is configured entirely by XML files.
Because there is no GUI, and because it's file driven, and because it runs on
Java, DiffKit is able to execute in a huge range of computing environments--
Windows and Mac desktops, or Linux and Solaris servers. These characteristics
also make DiffKit ideal for scripting or embedding into process chains. Also,
DiffKit was designed with high-volume applications in mind. It uses a
row-streaming mechanism to maintain a very low memory overhead during diff
execution, so DiffKit is able to quickly and efficiently diff tables that have
tens of millions of rows.

What DiffKit is not 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DiffKit is not a visual comparison tool; it does not have a GUI. DiffKit is not
a code or unstructured text comparison tool-- it is designed to compare tables
(data that is arranged in rows and columns). If you want to compare unstructured
text, you should use Unix diffutils
footnote:[http://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/.]. DiffKit is not a
synchronization tool. DiffKit has no capabilities to patch one side to make it
look like the other side; i.e. it can only report differences, not act on them.
DiffKit is not an RDBMS schema synchronization tool. There are many products on
the market that already do this. While you *can* use DiffKit to diff RDBMS
schemas, you will have to supply the configuration files yourself-- out of the
box DiffKit does not know how to identify the schema or catalog tables for any
particular vendor product. Finally, DiffKit is not very helpful for diff'ng
binary files. The diff reporting mechanism is oriented towards data types that
can be displayed as text.

Why use DiffKit?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are many uses for DiffKit, a couple of which are explored in detail in
<<Motivations-and-Uses,Motivations and Uses>>. Briefly, DiffKit is an excellent
application for enterprise data regression. It's quite common that enterprise
systems have complex workflows that produce large or complex RDBMS data output.
By diff'ng newly produced table values against expected table values, you can
ensure that you do not experience unanticipated changes to output as a result of
changes to the process. Likewise, most enterprise development environments rely
on different databases for different stages in the SDLC. It can become difficult
to keep the database objects in synch across these different environments.
DiffKit can diff the schemas to report on differences amongst the same database
objects across different environments.

There are many reasons to use DiffKit rather than other products. DiffKit is
free and open source. Also, as far as I know, there are no products on the
market, commercial or free, that are designed for high-performance, high-volume,
enterprise data diff'ng. Also, DiffKit is command-line driven, so it is
conveniently scriptable and embeddable into workflows. DiffKit has a clean,
simple, Object Oriented Design that makes it easy for Java programmers to
extend. Finally, DiffKit is a high quality product, undergoing continuous
testing to ensure the accuracy of its results.

Quality control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The integrity of DiffKit is maintained via two levels of testing: unit testing,
and high level functional regression testing. The DiffKit project contains
110+ low-level unit tests. These tests are executed before each release.
But more importantly, the DiffKit standalone application carries with it a
complete, high-level functional regression suite. Not only is this test suite
exercised before every release but, because it is embedded in the standalone
application, end-users are able to execute this test suite at any time. For a
detailed description of this test suite, read <<Test-Cases,Test Cases>>.


Tutorial
--------

Tutorial 1 -- Diff'ng flat-file tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In this tutorial we will diff two CSV files. Like most diff utilities, DiffKit
arbitrarily names one of the tables (files) the Left Hand Side (_LHS_) and the
other table (file) the Right Hand Side (_RHS_). In order to carry out a diff,
DiffKit must be configured with the location of the LHS and RHS tables, the
characteristics of the comparison, and a description of the desired output. All
of this information is specified in a _Plan_ file. A Plan file is an XML
configuration file (for enterprise Java programmers, it's a Spring bean
configuration file). There are two kinds of plans: _MagicPlan_ and
_PassthroughPlan_. In this example we will use a _MagicPlan_.

This plan is called _Magic_ because it infers a lot of information, rather than
requiring the user to fully specify every last detail of how the comparison
should be carried out. The goal of the magic plan is to allow the user to
specify the bare minimum amount of information required to accurately perform
the diff.

In this example, that bare minimum of information is: the LHS file name, the RHS
file name, and the name of a file to send the output to. Information that is
*not* specified here, which the MagicPlan will infer, includes: which columns
should be diff'd, what _key_ should be used to match each row from the LHS to a
row on the RHS, how to map columns on the left to columns on the right, and what
type of comparison (which _Diffor_) to apply at each LHS-column-to-RHS-column
mapping. In the case of the MagicPlan, the convenient default specifications
that the MagicPlan provides are: all columns that appear on both the LHS and RHS
will be diffed, other columns are ignored; the first column on each side is
designated the _key_ (analogous to a SQL key), used to join the rows; each
column on the LHS will be mapped to the column on the RHS having the same name;
an exact textual comparison will be performed (_DKEqualsDiffor_ will be
applied).

After you have unzipped the DiffKit distribution (diffkit-<version>.zip), you
should see these files and directories:
-----------------
conf/
diffkit-app.jar
doc/
eg/
-----------------
diffkit-app.jar is the standalone java application. It is completely
self-contained, and can be run this way:
-----------------
java -jar diffkit-app.jar
-----------------

All of the data and configuration files needed for this tutorial are in the eg/
directory:
-----------------
cd eg/
-----------------
All of the files in this directory come from the DiffKit builtin
<<Test-Cases,Test Case suite>>. In this tutorial, we will start by invoking the
same diff that TestCase9 invokes. It utilizes these files:
-----------------
test9.lhs.csv
test9.rhs.csv
test9.plan.xml
-----------------
We want DiffKit to compare the data table in test9.lhs.csv with that in
test9.rhs.csv. The plan for this is almost as simple as a plan can get:

.test9.plan.xml
-----------------
<beans ...>
	<bean id="plan" class="org.diffkit.diff.conf.DKMagicPlan">
		<property name="lhsFilePath" value="./test9.lhs.csv" />
		<property name="rhsFilePath" value="./test9.rhs.csv" />
		<property name="sinkFilePath" value="./test9.sink.diff" />
	</bean>
</beans>
-----------------
This file shows that we are using a _MagicPlan_ (instead of a
_PassthroughPlan_) and where to find the LHS and RHS csv files. It also
specifies where the _Sink_ should write its output file. A _Sink_ is where diffs
are sent to for formatting. We can run the diff this way:
-----------------
java -jar ../diffkit-app.jar -planfiles test9.plan.xml
-----------------
DiffKit prints a summary of the results to the console:
-----------------
diff'd 8 rows in 0:00:00.009, found:
!4 row diffs
@2 column diffs
-----------------
The summary tells us that there were 4 row diffs; a row diff occurs when DiffKit
finds a row on one side, but no corresponding row on the other side. Rows are
uniquely identified by a _key_ (analogous to a primary key in relational DBs)
which defaults to column1 if not otherwise specified. The summary states that
there were also 2 column diffs, which means that DiffKit was able to join
(align) the rows, but that values in some of the columns were different between
the left and right hand side.

Running test9.plan.xml above created an output (diff) file named
test9.sink.diff. That file contains an entry for each diff discovered. The first
entry in that file describes a column diff:

.test9.sink.diff
-----------------
@{column1=1111}
column2
<1111
>xxxx
-----------------
It tells us that the row identified by the key value (column1=1111) has a column
diff in column2. The lhs value for column2 is 1111 while the rhs value is xxxx.
The next entry in the diff file describes a row diff:

.test9.sink.diff cont.
-----------------
!{column1=2222}
<
-----------------
This indicates that the row identified by column1=2222 is missing from the lhs.
Or put another way, this row is present on the rhs and not present on the lhs.
You should open test9.lhs.csv side-by-side with test9.rhs.csv in order to verify
that all entries in the diff file match your expectations.

test11.plan.xml shows how to explicitly specify which columns constitute the
_key_, used to align (join) the rows between lhs and rhs:

.test11.plan.xml
-----------------
   ...
   <property name="keyColumnNames">
      <list>
         <value>column3</value>
   ...
-----------------


test13.plan.xml demonstrates how to instruct DiffKit to consider only certain
columns during comparison, ignoring all other columns:

.test13.plan.xml
-----------------
   ...
   <property name="diffColumnNames">
      <list>
         <value>column2</value>
   ...
-----------------
It also shows how to specify that rows should be identified in the output (diff)
file by values other than the key values:

.test13.plan.xml cont.
-----------------
   ...
   <property name="displayColumnNames">
      <list>
         <value>column1</value>
         <value>column3</value>
   ...
-----------------

test14.plan.xml demonstrates how to tell DiffKit to consider all
columns during comparison except for a specified list (blacklist).

.test14.plan.xml
-----------------
   ...
   <property name="ignoreColumnNames">
      <list>
         <value>column3</value>
         <value>column4</value>
   ...
-----------------

test21.plan.xml shows how to specify which _kinds_ of diffs should be
considered: ROW_DIFF, COLUMN_DIFF, or BOTH (default). It also shows how to tell
DiffKit to halt diffing after a certain number of diffs has been recorded:

.test21.plan.xml
-----------------
   ...
   <property name="diffKind" value="ROW_DIFF" />
   <property name="maxDiffs" value="2" />
   ...
-----------------



Tutorial 2 -- Diff'ng database tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NOTE: You should complete Tutorial 1 before starting on this tutorial. Tutorial
1 introduces terminology that is used here.

In this tutorial we will diff two RDBMS database tables. Diff'ng DB tables uses
plan files in the same fashion as diff'ng files. But instead of file paths, you
must provide table names in the plan file, and you must also tell DiffKit how to
connect to the LHS and RHS databases.

The DiffKit standalone application (diffkit-app.jar) carries with it a fully
functional embedded SQL database: H2 footnote:[http://www.h2database.com/.]. The
storage for the tutorial H2 database is in a single file: eg/demo.h2.db.
Appropriate database tables have been created in demo.h2.db and prepopulated
with all of the data in files test10.lhs.csv and test10.rhs.csv. The CSV files
are here simply as a convenience, to allow you to see the test data without
having to open a database browser. If you would like to directly view the H2
tables and data, you need a DB browser that can use a type 4 JDBC driver to
connect to a database. DiffKit can run the embedded H2 DB as a tcp server from
the eg/ directory, allowing you to connect from an external DB browser:
-----------------
java -jar ../diffkit-app.jar -demoDB
-----------------
Then configure a connection to this demo database within your favorite JDBC
enabled database browser:
-----------------
driver name: H2 JDBC Driver
driver class name: org.h2.Driver
driver jar: h2-1.2.135.jar (you can unzip diffkit-app.jar to get a copy)
connection URL: jdbc:h2:<absolute path of eg/ directory>/demo
database name: demo
username: test
password: test
-----------------
Your DB browser will show you the tables TEST10_LHS_TABLE and TEST10_RHS_TABLE
(amongst others) populated with the data values from the corresponding CSV
files.

test10.plan.xml demonstrates how to specify the table names used in the
comparison:

.test10.plan.xml
-----------------
   ...
   <property name="lhsDBTableName" value="TEST10_LHS_TABLE" />
   <property name="rhsDBTableName" value="TEST10_RHS_TABLE" />
   <property name="dbConnectionInfo" ref="connectionInfo" />
   ...
-----------------
In this case, both tables reside in the same database, referenced by
"connectionInfo". Of course we also have to provide values for connectionInfo.
We could put the connectionInfo element for these tables in the test10.plan.xml
file, and then all information needed for the diff would be in one config file.
Instead, we isolate the database connectionInfo values into a separate file:

.dbConnectionInfo.xml
-----------------
   ...
   <bean id="connectionInfo" class="org.diffkit.db.DKDBConnectionInfo">
     <constructor-arg index="0" value="test" />
     <constructor-arg index="1" value="H2" />
     <constructor-arg index="2" value="file:./demo" />
     <constructor-arg index="3">
			<null />
     </constructor-arg>
     <constructor-arg index="4">
			<null />
     </constructor-arg>
     <constructor-arg index="5" value="test" />
     <constructor-arg index="6" value="test" />
  </bean>
-----------------
This allows us to reuse the connectionInfo in other plans as well. The
connectionInfo points to an embedded H2 database named "test", which is stored
in a file at "./demo" (i.e. eg/demo.h2.db). The username is "test" and the
password is "test". An embedded H2 database will run in the same process as
DiffKit itself-- you do not need to run the diffkit-app.jar demoDB. To run the
test10 plan:
-----------------
java -jar ../diffkit-app.jar -planfiles test10.plan.xml,dbConnectionInfo.xml
-----------------
Test10 shows that DiffKit allows the user to specify what _key_ should be used
to join (align) the rows, even if a different SQL primary key (PK) is already 
defined within the database:

.test10.plan.xml cont.
-----------------
   ...
   <property name="keyColumnNames">
      <list>
         <value>COLUMN3</value>
   ...
-----------------

In this particular case, the PK defined in the database for both tables is
column1. If DiffKit had used column1 as its _key_, then all rows would have
appeared as row diffs, because no rows join. Instead, we specified that the
_key_ is column3, in which case all rows join and there are no row diffs.

DiffKit can compare tables across different physical and/or logical databases.
test18.plan.xml demonstrates this:

.test18.plan.xml
-----------------
   ...
   <bean id="connectionInfo" class="org.diffkit.diff.conf.DKMagicPlan">
     <property name="lhsDBTableName" value="TEST18_LHS_TABLE" />
     <property name="rhsDBTableName" value="TEST18_RHS_TABLE" />
     <property name="lhsDBConnectionInfo" ref="lhsDBConnectionInfo" />
     <property name="rhsDBConnectionInfo" ref="rhsDBConnectionInfo" />
     ...
   </bean>
-----------------
In this case, table "TEST18_LHS_TABLE" is located in a database pointed to
by ref="lhsDBConnectionInfo" while table "TEST18_RHS_TABLE" is located in a
database pointed to by ref="lhsDBConnectionInfo". Again, as in test10, the
values for the references to lhsDBConnectionInfo and rhsDBConnectionInfo are in
a separate file. However, in this case, lhsDBConnectionInfo and
rhsDBConnectionInfo are each in their own file: test18.rhs.dbConnectionInfo.xml
and test18.lhs.dbConnectionInfo.xml respectively. Inside, we can see that each
of these dbConnectionInfo.xml files specifies a connection to a different 
database:

.test18.lhs.dbConnectionInfo.xml
---------------------------------
   ...
   <bean id="lhsDBConnectionInfo" class="org.diffkit.db.DKDBConnectionInfo">
      ...
      <constructor-arg index="2" value="file:./test18_lhs_demo" />
   ...
---------------------------------

.test18.rhs.dbConnectionInfo.xml
---------------------------------
   ...
   <bean id="rhsDBConnectionInfo" class="org.diffkit.db.DKDBConnectionInfo">
      ...
      <constructor-arg index="2" value="file:./test18_rhs_demo" />
   ...
---------------------------------
Then the plan can be executed this way:
-----------------
java -jar ../diffkit-app.jar -planfiles test18.plan.xml, 
     test18.lhs.dbConnectionInfo.xml,test18.rhs.dbConnectionInfo.xml
-----------------

DiffKit can also compare a file table with a DB table:

.test12.plan.xml
-----------------
   ...
   <property name="lhsDBTableName" value="TEST12_LHS_TABLE" />
   <property name="rhsFilePath" value="./test12.rhs.csv" />
   <property name="dbConnectionInfo" ref="connectionInfo" />
   ...
-----------------
In this case, you should put the DB table on the LHS, if you want to ensure
that DiffKit creates a TableModel from the DB table and applies that same 
TableModel to the file table as well. 

Test12 can be run this way:

-----------------
java -jar ../diffkit-app.jar -planfiles test12.plan.xml,dbConnectionInfo.xml
-----------------

Tutorial 3 -- Diff'ng spreadsheet tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NOTE: You should complete Tutorial 2 before starting on this tutorial. Tutorial
2 introduces terminology that is used here.

In this tutorial we will diff two Excel spreadsheet tables (sheets). Diff'ng
spreadsheet tables uses plan files in the same fashion as diff'ng flat-files or
DB tables. But instead of DB connection info, you must provide the path to the
spreadsheet file and the name of the sheet to use.

test33.plan.xml demonstrates how to specify the table names used in the
comparison:

.test33.plan.xml
-----------------
   ...
   <property name="lhsSpreadSheetFilePath" value="./test33.lhs.xls" />
   <property name="rhsSpreadSheetFilePath" value="./test33.rhs.xls" />
   <property name="hasHeader" value="true" />
   <property name="sinkFilePath" value="./test33.sink.diff" />
   ...
-----------------

We don't specify the sheet name anywhere, so DiffKit will default to using the
first sheet in the workbook, which in this case happens to be named "Sheet1"
(the same in both documents). Also notice that hasHeader is set to "true". That
means DiffKit will use the first row (ROW_NUM =1) as the column name for each 
column. The output report will explain diffs using these column names instead of
the default Excel column names: A,B...AA,AB.... Finally, we did not specify the
key anywhere, which means that DiffKit will use the ROW_NUM as the key for the
sake of aligning the rows. Test34 (test34.plan.xml) demonstrates the results of
diff'ng spreadsheets that are nearly identical to those in test33, but using one
of the user columns (COLUMN1) as the key instead of ROW_NUM. The results are
completely different because of the different row alignments provided by the
different keys.


[[PassthroughPlan-Tutorial]]
Tutorial 4 -- PassthroughPlan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NOTE: You should complete Tutorial 3 before starting this tutorial. Tutorial 2
introduces terminology that is used here.

Tutorials 1, 2 and 3 used __MagicPlan__s. These plans are called "magic" because
not all of the information needed to carry out the diff'ng is explicitly
specified; most of it is inferred, using reasonable default assumptions.
However, sometimes you need finer control over the specification than is
possible with MagicPlan. In that case, you will need to use a _PassthroughPlan_.

At the heart of DiffKit is the _DiffEngine_. In order for the DiffEngine to
carry out a diff'ng, it must be given a complete specification of how to compare
the two tables. This specification is an element called the _TableComparison_
(<<Anatomy-Of-A-Diff, Fig. 2>>). For an explanation of TableComparisons, see
<<TableComparison,Concepts>>. Configuring a PassthroughPlan mostly concerns
building a TableComparison in the config file.

test7.plan.xml demonstrates how to build up a PassthroughPlan. You can see that,
unlike the previous tutorials, the plan "class" is PassthroughPlan, not 
MagicPlan:

.test7.plan.xml
--------------------
   ...
   <bean id="plan" class="org.diffkit.diff.conf.DKPassthroughPlan">
      ...
      <property name="tableComparison" ref="table.comparison" />
   ...
--------------------
And you also see above that a "tableComparison" is explicitly specified, unlike
in the case of the MagicPlan. Next we see how the tableComparison is composed
from primitive elements. First, each column must be explicitly modelled with
a ColumnModel element:

.test7.plan.xml cont.
--------------------
...
   <bean id="lhs.column1" class="org.diffkit.diff.engine.DKColumnModel">
      <constructor-arg index="0" value="0" />
      <constructor-arg index="1" value="column1" />
      <constructor-arg index="2" value="STRING" />
   </bean>
...
--------------------
Next, the ColumnModels are composed into TableModels:

.test7.plan.xml cont.
--------------------
...
   <bean id="lhs.table.model" class="org.diffkit.diff.engine.DKTableModel">
      <constructor-arg index="0">
         <list>
            <ref bean="lhs.column1" />
            <ref bean="lhs.column2" />
            <ref bean="lhs.column3" />
         </list>
      ...
...
--------------------
The TableModel specification includes not just the list of ColumnModels,
but also the list of column indexes that make up the _Key_:

.test7.plan.xml cont.
--------------------
      ...
      <constructor-arg index="1">
         <list>
            <value>0</value>
            <value>2</value>
         </list>
      ...
--------------------
Next, you have to include in the specification which _Diffor_ to use for each
ColumnComparison. Here we are going to just use the same generic EqualsDiffor
for all ColumnComparisons:

.test7.plan.xml cont.
--------------------
      ...
   <bean id="equalsDiffor" class="org.diffkit.diff.diffor.DKEqualsDiffor"
      factory-method="getInstance" />
      ...
--------------------

For each column pair that we want diff'd, we need to create a ColumnComparison,
which specifies the identity of the LHS column (ColumnModel), the RHS column,
and the Diffor to apply to these column values:

.test7.plan.xml cont.
--------------------
      ...
   <bean id="column1.comparison" class="org.diffkit.diff.engine.DKColumnComparison">
      <constructor-arg index="0" ref="lhs.column1" />
      <constructor-arg index="1" ref="rhs.column1" />
      <constructor-arg index="2" ref="equalsDiffor" />
   </bean>
      ...
--------------------

Finally, the above elements are composed into a TableComparison:

.test7.plan.xml cont.
--------------------
      ...
   <bean id="table.comparison" class="org.diffkit.diff.engine.DKStandardTableComparison">
      <constructor-arg index="0" ref="lhs.table.model" />
      <constructor-arg index="1" ref="rhs.table.model" />
      <constructor-arg index="2" value="BOTH" />
      <constructor-arg index="3">
         <list>
            <ref bean="column1.comparison" />
            <ref bean="column2.comparison" />
            <ref bean="column3.comparison" />
         </list>
      </constructor-arg>
      <constructor-arg index="4">
         <list>
            <value>1</value>
         </list>
      </constructor-arg>
      <constructor-arg index="5">
         <list>
            <list>
               <value>0</value>
               <value>2</value>
            </list>
            <list>
               <value>0</value>
               <value>2</value>
            </list>
         </list>
      </constructor-arg>
      <constructor-arg index="6" value="2" />
   </bean>
      ...
--------------------
The elements nested in the TableComparison specify: LHS and RHS TableModels
(index=0,index=1); the _Kind_ of Diffs to looks for, ROW_DIFF, COLUMN_DIFF, or
BOTH (index=2); a list of ColumnComparisons (index=3); a list of indexes (into
the list of ColumnComparisons) of which ColumnComparisons should actually
participate in the diff'ng (index=4); a list of indexes (into the respective
TableModel column lists), one for the LHS and one for the RHS, of which columns
to use for identifying rows in the output (index=5); and the maximum number of
diffs to record before stopping (index=6).

Test7 can be run with this command:

java -jar ../diffkit-app.jar -planfiles test7.plan.xml

[[Motivations-and-Uses]]
Motivations and Uses
--------------------

Data Regression testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Today, complex software workflows that output large amounts of data into an RDBMS
are fairly common. Most in-production enterprise software systems require
continuous maintenance, upgrade, enhancement, refinement, and migration. But
with each and every change to these systems, the maintainers must ensure that
only their intended changes are realized, and that there are no unintended
changes as side-effects. This concern is usually addressed through _regression_
testing.

In theory, regression testing processes that output data is fairly simple. 
You start with a fixed, predefined, set of inputs, and run these inputs through
the process before changes to the process are applied. You then apply your
process changes and run the changed process with the same set of inputs as the 
previous step. You then compare the outputs from the first step with the outputs
from the second step. They should be identical, or reflect only intended changes
to the process.

In practice, performing data regression on large, complex, RDBMS data sets is
quite challenging. Frequently, the exact same process run twice will not produce
exactly the same output. There will be data values that are senstive to when the
process was run (timestamps), and who ran the process (user ids). It's not
uncommon for some processes to produce some data values that are somewhat
non-deterministic (random). Also, if the data sets are large (millions of very
wide rows), performance of the diff'ng tools can become a roadblock. Comparing
large byte volumes requires tools that are very efficient in their use of
resources.

DiffKit is designed specifically for _enterprise_ diff'ng (although it is still
quite suitable for smaller scale projects).

.enterprise features:
Performance::
    DiffKit is designed to operate on large datasets-- tens of millions of rows.
    The DiffEngine will only ever hold 2 rows in memory at the same time. It
    does not require that whole datasets, or even chunks, be present in memory
    (Java heap) concurrently. As a result, DiffKit maintains a very small memory
    footprint at all times. Further, DiffKit is fairly fast.
    
Command line::
    DiffKit is strictly command-line driven-- it has no GUI. As a result,
    DiffKit can run on headless servers, as well as desktops. DiffKit is fully
    configured from files passed on the command-line, and does not require any
    complicated database backing for configuration. And DiffKit can send its
    output (diffs) to file as well. So DiffKit can be called from shell scripts,
    and easily embedded in process chains. DiffKit can be configured to exit
    with an error status code if diffs are detected. And since DiffKit is an
    open Java framework, it can be easily embedded into any Java application.
    
Customization::
    DiffKit is highly customizable. Configuration allows the user to include or
    ignore only certain rows/columns, to focus on only row or column type diffs,
    and to stop diff'ng after some diff count has been reached. Also, DiffKit
    can use a set of out-of-the-box __Diffor__s (comparators) to achieve
    sophisticated diff'ng tolerance, where anticipated or non-erroneous diffs
    can be ignored. Finally, with a little Java programming, you can plug in 
    Diffors that you write yourself, allowing limitless expression of diff and
    tolerance behavior.
    
    
DB schema comparison
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It's quite common in enterprise software development to maintain a chain of host
environments (logically independent machines), each of which represents a
different stage in the Sofware Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Typically, a
development team will maintain, at a bare minimum: Dev->QA->Prod. It's not
uncommon to see more elaborate chains, such as: Dev->Integration->QA->User
Acceptance->Performance->Dev. If the target application uses a SQL database for
storage, it's quite likely that the _schema_ (DDL) of that database is
continually evolving as other components of the system change. Then, a vital
issue becomes; how to ensure that the database objects (DDL) are "in synch" 
across all of these different, and evolving, environments.

All mainstream RDBMS databases maintain their schema (or catalog) in a special
set of sytems tables, called the system catalog views. With the proper plan
(configuration) files, DiffKit can detect and report differences between
database object definitions across different physical databases.


[[Concepts]]
Concepts
--------

[[Real-World-Entities]]
Real world entities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DiffKit is designed to compare _tables_ of data. These could come from an RDBMS
table, a CSV file, an Excel spreadsheet, or any other data that can be
represented in a table. In this context, table presumes a rectangular array of
values, where all of the values in the same column represent the same data
element; that is, values in the same column have the same meaning and same data
type. Rows represent different instances of the collection of column values.
Conceptually, data table means the same thing as a SQL table, however it can
come from any type of source.

Modelling entities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to provide the most flexibility, DiffKit internally creates a _meta
model_ of each entity involved in the diff operation (Figure 2). So DiffKit will
create a meta model of both the LHS source and the RHS source; the
centerpiece of those models are the __TableModel__s. It will also create meta
classes to represent how each column on the LHS is mapped to a column on the
RHS, and what _Diffor_ to use for determining whether values in that column
are different or the same. All of the underlined entities in Figure 2 are Java
classes, and are individually addressable and configurable through the use of a
<<PassthroughPlan,PassthroughPlan>>

[[Architecture]]
.architecture
image::architecture_hl.png[width=700]

TableModel
^^^^^^^^^^
The TableModel is a meta model describing all important aspects of a table
involved in the DiffKit invocation. What are the characteristics and placements
of each column, and what is the _Key_ used to align (join) its rows to another
table. The TableModel contains a _ColumnModel_ for each column that it models.
_TableModel_ is a Java class.

ColumnModel
^^^^^^^^^^
A ColumnModel is a meta model describing all important properties of a column
involved in the diff. These properties include the name, datatype, and
formatting defaults. _ColumnModel_ is a Java class.

[[Source]]
Source
~~~~~~
A Source is a place from which DiffKit will read data rows for diff'ng. Every
DiffKit invocation must specify a LHS and a RHS Source. Each Source is fully
meta modelled by a TableModel. DiffKit comes with built-in Sources for RDBMS 
databases and CSV files. Java programmers can easily build their own Sources
by implementing the java _Source_ interface (<<Custom-Source,Custom Source>>).

[[Sink]]
Sink
~~~~
A Sink is an output destination for Diffs. The _DiffEngine_ reads rows from the
LHS and RHS __Source__s, detects Diffs, and sends the Diffs to a Sink. The Sink,
depending on its type, will perform any of these tasks: format the Diffs, store
the Diffs, display the Diffs, aggregate Diff statistics. Out-of-the-box DiffKit
comes with a DBSink, which stores Diffs in a SQL DB, and a FileSink, which
formats Diffs and writes the formatted strings to a specified text file. Java
programmers can easily build their own Sources by implementing the java _Sink_
interface (<<Custom-Sink,Custom Sink>>).

Row Alignment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to compare rows from the LHS with those from the RHS, DiffKit must have
a basis for joining the two. For that, it uses a _Key_ (Figure 3). A Key is a
collection of RHS to LHS column associations. Conceptually, it's the same as SQL
Primary and Foreign keys. In Figure 3, the key comprises: LHS col1 maps to RHS
col1, and LHS col2 maps to RHS col2. DiffKit allows any number or type of
columns to participate in the key.

Plan
~~~~
Every DiffKit invocation is carried out according to a Plan. This specifies
everything that DiffKit needs in order to do its job: the identity of the LHS
and RHS Sources, the identity and configuration of the Sink, and the
_TableComparison_, which is a description of how to join the LHS to the RHS
rows, and how to compare a column on the LHS with a column on the RHS (Figure
3). There are two types of Plans: <<MagicPlan, MagicPlan>> and
<<PassthroughPlan, PassthroughPlan>>. Plans are fed to DiffKit via a set of
XML config files (Spring config files). Or Plans can be built programmatically,
if you are using DiffKit as a framework. _Plan_ is a Java interface.

[[TableComparison]]
TableComparison
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The _TableComparison_ fully specifies how the DiffEngine can carry out the
entire diff'ng operation. It maps LHS columns to RHS columns via
__ColumnComparison__s. It describes how to join rows on the LHS with rows on the
RHS. It can instruct the DiffEngine to stop diff'ng after a certain number of 
Diffs have been detected, or to search for only one (ROW_DIFF) or the other 
(COLUMN_DIFF) type of Diff. _TableComparison_ is a Java interface.


ColumnComparison
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
_ColumnComparison_ fully specifies how to carry out the comparison of one column
on the LHS to cone column on the RHS. It points to one _ColumnModel_ on each
side and specifies which _Diffor_ should apply. ColumnComparison is a Java class.

[[Diffor]]
Diffor
^^^^^^
A _Diffor_ is an operator that examines a single LHS column *value* against a
single RHS column value to determine if they are different or the same. DiffKit
comes with several built-in Diffors that provide great flexibility in what kinds
of differences are ignored (tolerance). Java programmers can easily build their
own Diffors by implementing the java _Diffor_ interface (<<Custom-Diffor,Custom
Diffor>>).


[[MagicPlan]]
MagicPlan
^^^^^^^^^
The _MagicPlan_ is one type of concrete plan that can be used to specify a plan.
The goal of the MagicPlan is to minimize the amount of information the user must
provide, as opposed to the _PassthroughPlan_, which requires the user to
explicitly provide every detailed aspect of information that is needed to carry
out the operation. MagicPlan will make reasonable assumptions about
specification that was not provided by the user. For instance, MagicPlan will
build ColumnComparisons by always matching a column on the LHS to the column on
the RHS that has the same column name. If a column name only appears on one side
or the other (can't be matched), then MagicPlan will not build a
ColumnComparison for it and it will not participate in the diff'ng. _MagicPlan_
is a Java class that implements the _Plan_ interface.

[[PassthroughPlan]]
PassthroughPlan
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The _PassthroughPlan_ is one type of concrete plan that can be used to specify a
plan. The goal of the _PassthroughPlan_ is to maximize the amount of control
that the user has over the diff'ng specification. So the PassthroughPlan
requires the user to explicitly build a ColumnComparison for every column
pairing that should participate in the diff'ng. PassthroughPlan allows the user,
for instance, to map columns on one side to columns on the other side that do
not have the same name or data type. It also allows users to specify any
arbitrary Diffor, including potentially a custom Diffor, for every
ColumnComparison in the specification.

[[Diff]]
Diff
~~~~
A _Diff_ is a record of a difference between a LHS data value a RHS data value.
Diffs come in two flavors: <<ROW_DIFF,ROW_DIFF>> and
<<COLUMN_DIFF,COLUMN_DIFF>>. Figure 3 shows a default TableComparison between
two sources of rows, and the resulting Diffs; there are 2 ROW_DIFFs and 3 
COLUMN_DIFFs.

[[Anatomy-Of-A-Diff]]
.anatomy of a diff
image::diff_anatomy.png[width=700]

[[ROW_DIFF]]
ROW_DIFF
^^^^^^^^^
A _ROW_DIFF_ is a record that a row (as identified by the join Key) is present
on one side, but not present on the other side. ROW_DIFFs are rows that could
not be joined according to the join _Key_. In Figure 3, there are two ROW_DIFFs:
the row identified by \{col1=B, col2=2} is missing from the RHS, and the row 
identified by \{col1=C, col2=3} is missing from the LHS.

[[COLUMN_DIFF]]
COLUMN_DIFF
^^^^^^^^^^^
A _COLUMN_DIFF_ is a record that a column value in a joined row is different
(according to the _Diffor_ in use) between the LHS and the RHS. In Figure 3. 
there are 3 COLUMN_DIFFs. The row identified by \{col1=D, col2=4} has a N on the
LHS for col5, but a Y on the RHS.  The row identified by \{col1=F, col2=6} has
2 COLUMN_DIFFs in it: one diff in col3 and one diff in col4.

[[Test-Cases]]
Test Cases
----------

The test suite comprises __TestCase__s. Each TestCase tests a particular scenario
which is specified in a configuration file. The TestCase includes inputs, both
left hand side (LHS) and right hand side (RHS), comparison configuration, and
expected output. The _TestCaseRunner_ will diff the LHS vs. the RHS and compare
the actual results with the expected (known good) results. If the actual results
do not match the expected results, the TestCase fails. DiffKit embeds a fully
functional H2 database in order to carry out RDBMS based comparison. Each
TestCase is fully documented. If you run the tests from the standalone
application, you can inspect the resulting "tcr" directory and there you will
find the input files, expected diff files and documentation (README) for each
TestCase.
