Description
----------
Demonstrate the use of ignoreColumnNames and displayColumnNames in MagicPlan.  There are diffs in 
column3 and column4. The plan uses ignorefColumnNames to exclude column3 and column4 from diffing,
ensuring that only row diffs are found (there are no column diffs in column2).  By default, only key columns
are used for display in the diff report, but the plan specifies that column1 and column3 should be used 
in the display of rows within the diff report.


Assumptions
-----------
- lhs & rhs are FILE tables
- lhs vs. rhs has both row and column diffs
- plan file supplies lhs table  and rhs table file paths
- plan file supplies file path for Sink
- lhs and rhs tables have identical structure
- MagicPlan reverse engineers TableModels from the column headers in the data file
- MagicPlan excludes column3 and column4 from diffing; only column2 is diffed
- MagicPlan forces non-default display columns in output: column1 & column3
- MagicPlan uses Equals Diff across the board
- MagicPlan defaults to looking for ROW and COLUMN type Diffs
- MagicPlan sets max diffs to Long.MAX

Expectations
-----------
- 3 row diffs
