test34 README
=========

Description
----------
Key is COLUMN1 instead of <ROW_NUM>,
and the spreadsheets are not pre-sorted (isSorted = false), so that DiffKit has to
sort them internally before diff'ng.
Compare SpreadSheet tables using a MagicPlan. Demonstrates leaving the sheet 
name blank in the plan, so that the first sheet is used by default. Demonstrates
how ROW_DIFFs are generated when rows are aligned on COLUMN1, instead of ROW_NUM
(e.g. Test31). Demonstrates use of header row (hasHeader -> true). 
Exercises several different data types. This is functionally same as test32, except
that this test is specified using a MagicPlan, but 32 uses a PassthroughPlan.

Assumptions
-----------
- lhs & rhs are SpreadSheet FILE tables
- MagicPlan supplies lhs and rhs spreadsheet file paths
- MagicPlan supplies file path for Sink
- lhs and rhs tables have identical structure
- No key is specified in the MagicPlan, so ROW_NUM should be used
- MagicPlan specifies that a header row is present, so will identify diffs
using column names from header, instead of default Excel column name (A,B,C....).

Expectations
-----------
- 3 ROW_DIFFs
