Description
----------
Compare two spreadsheet file tables using mostly automatic default provided by
the MagicPlan. Only the two file names are provided in the plan file.

Assumptions
-----------
- lhs & rhs are SpreadSheet FILE tables
- lhs vs. rhs has no diffs
- plan file supplies lhs and rhs spreadsheet file paths
- plan file supplies file path for Sink
- lhs and rhs tables have identical structure
- MagicPlan reverse engineers TableModels from the spreadsheet
- MagicPlan generates default TableComparison by aligning lhs column to rhs
column based on name 
- no sheet name specified, so it will default to the first one
- MagicPlan always default isSorted to TRUE
- MagicPlan always defaults hasHeader to TRUE

Expectations
-----------
- No Diffs
